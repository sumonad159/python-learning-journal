We started off the course after going through the syllabus on what parts of a computer are and do along with what programming is. CPU, RAM, GPUs are all terms I've heard of, but it was nice to get formal definitions of what they actually are, for example the difference between RAM and HDD. Thinking of aany program being able to be simplified down to the same 5 steps (input, output, math, decision, repitition) makes programming seem less intimidating as well. We went over variable naming conventions as well. I'm only used to using variables in algebra (& biology haha) so I will approach variables in Python as slightly different than in my previous math knowledge.
